        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
          <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

        <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
        <p>With the keyword var. For example,<code>var x = 42.</code>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
        <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,<code>x = 42.</code>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
        <p>With the keyword let. For example,<code>let y = 13.</code>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>

        <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
        <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.<code>if (true) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;var x = 5;<br>
}<br>
console.log(x);  // 5</code></p>
        <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.<code>if (true) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;let y = 5;<br>
}<br>
console.log(y);<br>
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</code></p>
